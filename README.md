## Hi there 👋

I am currently a second-year **Master's Student at Kanazawa University**, Japan. While my academic research focuses on **Computer Vision & Deep Learning**, I have developed a strong passion for **Cybersecurity**.

🔭 **Current Research:**
- **Multimodal Deep Learning for Sign Language:** Developing a framework that combines **Lip Reading** and **Hand Gesture Recognition** using advanced Deep Learning architectures.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Smart Contract Auditing:** Investigating a hybrid approach to reduce false positives in static analysis by using **LLM-based verification** and automated code repair mechanisms.

🔙 **Previous Research:**
- **[Exploring 3D Convolutional Neural Network Models for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification](https://doi.org/10.51747/energy.v15i2.15208)**
  *Published in ENERGY Journal (2025).*
  > Implemented a **3D ResNet-18** architecture to classify Alzheimer's stages from ADNI MRI datasets, outperforming standard ADNet and Vision Transformer models.

- **[Hand Gesture Recognition-Based Control System Using Computer Vision for Transporter Robot](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRAMET60171.2023.10366557)**
  *Published in IEEE Xplore (2023).*
  > Designed a dual-hand robot control system using **MediaPipe**: the **Right Hand** controls navigation (**100% accuracy**) and the **Left Hand** controls the gripper (**97% accuracy**).

🌱 **I’m currently learning:**
- **Cybersecurity Blue Teaming:** SOC, Security Engineering, & DevSecOps.
- **Cloud Security:** Defending and Attacking AWS environments.
- **Advanced Python** for Deep Learning architectures.

⚡ **Tech Stack:**
- **Languages:** Python, Solidity.
- **AI Tools:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe.
- **Productivity:** Git.
